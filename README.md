# Automation-Terraform
CCGC 5502 Automation Assignment
This assignment provides learners with a real-world challenging scenario of codifying infrastructure
and provisioning it in the Azure cloud. The assignment challenges them to apply their Terraform and
Microsoft Azure knowledge and skills gained from the course to build a highly available, scalable,
and secure infrastructure using a variety of Azure services, resources, and features across multiple
availability zones. Learners are expected to use a development platform of their choice—Visual
Studio Code, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), GitBash, or a VM installed locally on their own
laptop computers—to complete the assignment. They need to frequently access the Azure portal.
